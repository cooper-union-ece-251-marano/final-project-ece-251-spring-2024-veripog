### ALU Operand Size

- **32 bits**. The ALU handles 32-bit inputs `a` and `b`.

### Address Bus Size

- **32 bits**. Both the program counter (`pc`) and memory addresses (`dataadr`) are 32-bit wide, implying that the processor uses a 32-bit address space.

### Addressability

- **Byte addressable**. MIPS is typically byte addressable, which means each address points to an individual byte.

### Register File Size

- **32 registers**. Each register is 32 bits wide, typical for MIPS architectures.

### Opcode Size

- **6 bits**. The opcode part of the instructions (`instr[31:26]`) is 6 bits, used to determine the type of operation.

### Function Size

- **6 bits**. The function field (`funct`) for R-type instructions (`instr[5:0]`) is 6 bits.

### shamt Size

- Not explicitly shown in this code but typically **5 bits** in MIPS for shift amount in shift instructions.

### Instruction Size

- **32 bits**. Each instruction, as handled in `instr`, is 32 bits long.

### PC Increment

- **4 bytes** (`32'b100` which is 4 in binary), as seen in the `pcadd1` adder module in the datapath. This increment corresponds to the standard MIPS instruction length.

### Immediate Size

- **16 bits**. Immediate values (`instr[15:0]`) are sign-extended from 16 bits to 32 bits in the `signext` module.

### R-type Instruction Support

- **Yes**. The architecture supports R-type instructions, which operate on registers only and are decoded with a `6'b000000` opcode.

### I-type Instruction Support

- **Yes**. The processor supports I-type instructions, which include immediate data.

### Memory Reference Support

- **Yes**. Load (`LW`) and Store (`SW`) instructions are supported for memory operations.

### J-type Instruction Support

- **Yes**. Jump (`J`) instruction is supported, which uses a direct address method for jumping within the code.

### Supported Instructions

- **R-type Instructions**: ADD (`6'b100000`), SUB (`6'b100010`), AND (`6'b100100`), OR (`6'b100101`), SLT (`6'b101010`).
- **I-type Instructions**: LW (`6'b100011`), SW (`6'b101011`), BEQ (`6'b000100`), ADDI (`6'b001000`).
- **J-type Instructions**: J (`6'b000010`).

The processorâ€™s design reflects a standard MIPS single-cycle architecture, commonly used in educational settings to illustrate basic computer architecture concepts.
